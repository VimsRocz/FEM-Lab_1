Static structural analysis of an I-beam
Our crane uses an I-beam for loading of goods. The I-beam dimensions are mm, mm,
mm and mm. For simplicity a fixed support shall be assumed at the wall side. The
crane shall be carrying 200 kgs of coffee and shall be utilized to the end of the beam. The function of the
crane shall be verified by determining the factor of safety (yield strength) at the maximum loading using
three methods:
1. Analytic Solution using formula given in lecture
2.
Using a “1-D” analysis with a beam element
3. Using a 3-D FEM analysis
Further tasks:
4. Use the 3D FEM analysis to perform a parameter study for
and of the beam keeping them identical. What is the minimum width to maintain a factor of safety of 1.2?
5.
Compare the results of all three methods and discuss the computation time and the impact of the mesh
size.
Document all simulations in line with the best practices presented in the lecture and provided on StudIp.
For further instructions or help you may use the material from the lecture.
